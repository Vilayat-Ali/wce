# WCE Tech Stack Overview

Welcome to the tech stack documentation for our project! This document highlights the technologies powering both our frontend and backend systems.

---

## Frontend: React

### Description
**React** is a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces, maintained by Facebook. It allows developers to create fast and interactive UIs with components that manage their state efficiently.

### How We Are Using It
In our project, we use **React** for building the frontend UI. It helps us manage complex UI states and render components efficiently. React's declarative syntax allows us to write clean, reusable components and provides a seamless user experience.

## Frontend: Vite

### Description
**Vite** is a build tool that focuses on speed. It serves as the frontend development server and build tool, offering fast hot module replacement (HMR) and optimized production builds.

### How We Are Using It
We use **Vite** as the bundler and development server for our React application. Its fast hot reloads during development and optimized builds for production make it a perfect tool for our needs.

## Frontend: SWC

### Description
**SWC** (Speedy Web Compiler) is a fast JavaScript/TypeScript compiler written in Rust. It is designed to be a replacement for Babel, and it significantly improves performance during build time.

### How We Are Using It
In our project, **SWC** is used to compile JavaScript and TypeScript code. We use it with Vite to ensure that our frontend builds are lightning-fast.

## Backend: Rust

### Description
**Rust** is a systems programming language focused on performance, reliability, and safety. It provides memory safety without needing a garbage collector.

### How We Are Using It
**Rust** is used for the backend of our project. Its performance and safety features make it an ideal choice for building reliable and high-performance services.

---

## Backend: Tokio

![Tokio](https://tokio.rs/images/tokio-logo.svg)

### Description
**Tokio** is an asynchronous runtime for Rust, providing support for concurrent programming. It is built around the async/await pattern, making it ideal for handling I/O-bound tasks efficiently.

### How We Are Using It
We use **Tokio** in our backend to handle asynchronous operations, enabling us to perform I/O-bound tasks (like database queries and HTTP requests) concurrently. This helps our system scale efficiently under load.

---

## Database: PostgreSQL

### Description
**PostgreSQL** is a powerful, open-source relational database system that uses and extends the SQL language. It is known for its performance, scalability, and advanced features.

### How We Are Using It
We use **PostgreSQL** to store structured data in a relational format. It handles complex queries and transactions efficiently, making it the core data storage for our backend services.

---

## Database: MongoDB

![MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/community-logo.svg)

### Description
**MongoDB** is a NoSQL database that uses a document-oriented data model. It is known for its flexibility and scalability, allowing developers to store data in JSON-like format.

### How We Are Using It
We use **MongoDB** for unstructured or semi-structured data that doesnâ€™t fit neatly into a relational model. It allows us to scale quickly and store diverse data types in an easily accessible format.

---

## Communication: gRPC

![gRPC](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a9/Grpc_logo.svg)

### Description
**gRPC** (gRPC Remote Procedure Call) is a high-performance, open-source and universal RPC framework. It allows communication between services in a microservice architecture.

### How We Are Using It
We use **gRPC** to enable efficient, low-latency communication between our backend microservices. It uses Protocol Buffers (Protobuf) as an interface definition language, making data serialization and deserialization fast and compact.

---

## Microservice Architecture

![Microservices](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/09/Microservices_Architecture_Overview.png)

### Description
**Microservice Architecture** is an architectural style that structures an application as a collection of loosely coupled services. These services communicate over a network, allowing for independent deployment and scalability.

### How We Are Using It
Our backend is designed with a **Microservice Architecture** to ensure that each service is isolated, can scale independently, and can be developed and deployed without affecting other services. We use **gRPC** to ensure efficient communication between microservices.

---

## Conclusion

With the combination of **React**, **Vite**, **SWC**, and **Rust** along with robust databases like **PostgreSQL** and **MongoDB**, our project is able to deliver high-performance frontend and backend services. The **microservice architecture** and **gRPC** communication ensure that our system is scalable, reliable, and efficient.

We are excited to continue leveraging these technologies to provide a seamless and efficient experience for our users.
